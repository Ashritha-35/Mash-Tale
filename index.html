               <b><b>Deep</b> inside my <em>heart</em>......full of grim. <br />
Dark raises to myriad secrets.<br /> 
My fantasies are confined to the barriers of lavatory. <br /> 
My <em>rips</em> arrested under my veil.<br />  
No one will <em>foster</em> my thoughts. <br /> 
Cause.... I won't seem to be a will <em>achiever</em>. <br /> 
<b>Dark inside</b>!.....there is no lane to shine my wings. <br /> 
Chagrin scatter all over my carcass. <br /> 
Cause... Though i show my skill in any thing no one will give me a helping hand. <br /> 
Yet, there is an expectancy, that someone will present in this cosmos to cherish my life.......<br /></b> </h2> 
                   <h3 align="center">.......................................</h3> <br /> 
            <p><b><b>After</b> awaiting for years...... <br /> 
Lastly, there comes my chap as a <b>consort</b>. <br /> 
This <em>chap</em> appeared to me as a ocean in desert. <br /> 
Abruptly, i felt like a fish fallen in aqua from a poacher's bait. <br /> 
Finally,my caretaker, my <em>well wisher</em>, my dream achiever pot, my real address came into my life. <br /> 
<big>He became my strength and the sword of my all success.</big><br />  
He taught me a lot about life and the people in this world.
As expected twist in all stories.....in my life also there came a life theart to my life and now it's my to pass on in a few days.<br />
I am obliged to my chap and he became my full strength to cross all my barriers in my life.<br />
But....now I desire to live with my consort!<br />
Even so my own fate is <small>fading</small>.....</b>
